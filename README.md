Text encryptor with 8 possible layers of encryption. Possibility of changing the 
coding and decoding functions aswell with reading the decryption text from a desired location 
on your computer. Demonstration version doesn't contain the hex conversions for every character
and the program itself is working on 1 thread which is not optimal for more than 2 encryption layers.
